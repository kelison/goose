Test the connection\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe config template includes:\n\n- `api_key`: Your API key (get from the provider's dashboard)\n- `endpoint`: API endpoint URL\n- `timeout`: Request timeout in seconds (default: 30)\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter setup, verify:\n\n- [ ] Config file is valid JSON\n- [ ] API key is set and not a placeholder\n- [ ] Test connection succeeds\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Connection Timeout\n\nIf you experience connection timeouts:\n\n1. Check your network connection\n2. Verify the endpoint URL is correct\n3. Increase the timeout value in config\n\n### Authentication Errors\n\nIf you get 401/403 errors:\n\n1. Verify your API key is correct\n2. Check if the key has the required permissions\n3. Ensure the key hasn't expired\n",

The final score is:\n\n```\nFinal Score = Σ (weight × P(action))\n```\n\n## Engagement Signals\n\n### Positive Signals (boost your content)\n| Signal | Action |\n|--------|--------|\n| `P(favorite)` | Likes |\n| `P(reply)` | Replies - **high weight** |\n| `P(repost)` | Retweets |\n| `P(quote)` | Quote tweets - **high weight** |\n| `P(share)` | Shares via DM, copy link |\n| `P(click)` | Tweet expansion clicks |\n| `P(profile_click)` | Profile visits |\n| `P(video_view)` | Video quality views (VQV) |\n| `P(photo_expand)` | Photo expansion |\n| `P(dwell)` | Time spent reading |\n| `P(follow_author)` | New followers |\n\n### Negative Signals (hurt your content)\n| Signal | Action |\n|--------|--------|\n| `P(not_interested)` | \"Not interested\" clicks |\n| `P(block_author)` | Blocks |\n| `P(mute_author)` | Mutes |\n| `P(report)` | Reports |\n\n## Content Strategy Rules\n\n### 1. Optimize for Engagement Depth\nCreate content that drives multiple engagement types:\n- Ask questions to drive replies\n- Share insights worth quote-tweeting\n- Include content that increases dwell time\n\n### 2. Video Gets Special Treatment\nThe algorithm has a dedicated `VQV_WEIGHT` for videos. Consider:\n- Demo videos of products/features\n- Screen recordings of workflows\n- Quick tutorials\n\n### 3. Avoid Negative Signals\n- Don't spam or over-post (triggers mutes)\n- Stay focused on developer value (avoid off-topic controversy)\n- Don't be overly promotional\n\n### 4. Author Diversity Penalty\nThe algorithm penalizes multiple posts from the same author in a feed:\n```\nmultiplier = (1.0 - floor) × decay^position + floor\n```\n**Quality over quantity** - space out posts, let one perform before posting another.\n\n### 5. In-Network Priority\nContent from followed accounts gets priority. Build genuine followers in the dev community.\n\n### 6. Freshness Matters\nPosts older than a threshold get filtered. Post when developers are active:\n- Weekday mornings (9-11am)\n- Lunch breaks (12-1pm)\n- After work (5-7pm)\n\n## Content Types for Developers\n\n| Type | Why It Works |\n|------|--------------|\n| Build logs | High dwell time, replies, profile clicks |\n| Hot takes on dev tools | Replies, quote tweets, shares |\n| Code snippets with context | Photo expand, dwell |\n| \"TIL\" moments | Relatable, shareable |\n| Demo videos | Video quality views, shares |\n| Open source updates | Profile clicks, follows, reposts |\n| Bug stories | High engagement across all metrics |\n\n## Post Templates\n\n### Build in Public\n```\n🦆 Just shipped [feature] in [project]\n\nThe tricky part was [technical challenge]\n\nHere's how we solved it: [brief explanation]\n\nWhat would you have done differently?\n```\n\n### Developer Pain Point\n```\nUnpopular opinion: [controversial dev take]\n\nHere's why: [reasoning]\n\nAm I wrong? Tell me why 👇\n```\n\n### Show Don't Tell\n```\n[Video/GIF of product doing something cool]\n\nNo setup. No config. Just works.\n\nTry it: [link]\n```\n\n### TIL Format\n```\nTIL: [surprising technical fact]\n\nI always thought [common misconception]\n\nBut actually [the truth + why it matters]\n\nThread 🧵\n```\n\n### Bug Story\n```\nThis bug took me [time] to find 😅\n\nSymptoms: [what was happening]\nWhat I tried: [failed attempts]\nThe actual cause: [surprising root cause]\n\nLesson learned: [takeaway]\n```\n\n## Checklist Before Posting\n\n- [ ] Does this provide genuine value to developers?\n- [ ] Is there a hook that encourages replies or quotes?\n- [ ] Have I spaced this out from my last post?\n- [ ] Is the timing good for developer audiences?\n- [ ] Does this avoid triggering mutes/blocks (spam, off-topic controversy)?\n- [ ] For threads: Is the first tweet compelling enough to stand alone?\n\n## Keywords to Avoid\n\nMany developers mute these - use sparingly or avoid:\n- Excessive emojis or hype language\n- \"10x\", \"game-changer\", \"revolutionary\"\n- Generic marketing speak\n- Crypto/Web3 terms (unless relevant)\n\n## Source\n\nBased on analysis of the open-sourced X algorithm: https://github.com/xai-org/x-algorithm\n",
